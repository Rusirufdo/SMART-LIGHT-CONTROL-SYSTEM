# Smart Light Control System

Empowering efficiency through automated lighting.

---

## Project Overview

The **Smart Light Control System** is an energy-efficient and user-friendly solution designed to address the challenges of unnecessary energy consumption caused by forgetting to turn off lights. This system automatically controls lighting by detecting human presence using sensors like PIR (Passive Infrared) and millimeter-wave sensors. By optimizing energy usage, it helps reduce electricity bills, extend the lifespan of bulbs, and promote environmental sustainability.
